This is our GGJ15 project.

Strange round beasts are about to enroach on your glorious country! Your bitter rivaling neighbour has agreed to a tenuous defensive pact against the common threat, but screw those guys. You're not about to spend any more of your state budget to help them than is absolutely necessary. If they are left incapable of defending themselves properly, surely the cornerless aliens will be content with conquering your rival only...

Two player game that forces you to play Co-op while also competing against each other in a race of depleting resources.

Controls with WAD and <^>
